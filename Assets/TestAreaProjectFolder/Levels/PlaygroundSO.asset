  - titleString: Safety engineering
    contentString: Safety engineering is an engineering discipline which assures
      that engineered systems provide acceptable levels of safety. It is strongly
      related to industrial engineering/systems engineering, and the subset system
      safety engineering. Safety engineering assures that a life-critical system
      behaves as needed, even when components fail.

  - titleString: Swing (seat)
    contentString: A swing is a seat, often found at playgrounds for children, at
      a circus for acrobats, or on a porch for relaxing, although they may also be
      items of indoor furniture, such as the Latin American hammock or the Indian
      oonjal. The seat of a swing may be suspended from chains or ropes. Once a swing
      is in motion, it continues to oscillate like a pendulum until external interference
      or drag brings it to a halt. Swing sets are very popular with children.
